# rss-markup-task
For checking the task please use dist directory => index.html or (in main directory) you may use `npm i` and then `gulp` in command line.  
I added `pixel-glass` for convinient control if the markdown is pixel perfect. This package is good alternative for perfect pixel.  
You should uncomment blocks of code in index.html on lines 10-17 and lines 475-476 to use it.
